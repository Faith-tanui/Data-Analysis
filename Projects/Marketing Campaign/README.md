# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

### Power BI • SQL • Data Cleaning • Insight Storytelling

This project is based on the **Digital Marketing Performance Dataset** by Slidescope (via ColorsTech):

I used the dataset to create an end-to-end marketing analytics project that shows my skills in cleaning messy data, building dashboards in Power BI, creating accurate DAX measures, and communicating insights that drive business decisions.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to understand how different marketing channels, products, regions, and seasons impact overall performance. I aimed at answering questions like:

* Which channels generate the most revenue?
* Which channels are the most efficient?
* Which products are worth investing more in?
* Which regions perform best?
* How does performance change by season?
* Where are we losing potential customers in the conversion funnel?

This project shows my ability to turn raw data into a clear, actionable story that a marketing or business team could use to make strategic decisions.

## 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

The dataset included real-world issues such as:

* Missing values (nulls)
* Inconsistent formatting
* Spelling variations and extra spaces
* Date fields stored as text

To make the dataset usable, I cleaned and transformed it using:

* SQL (for validation, fixing blanks, consistent formatting)
* DAX (for creating accurate KPIs after the data model was built)

## 🎯 **Key Insights**

### **Product Performance**

* **Product C** is the top performer — highest revenue and highest ROI.
* Product D underperforms consistently across channels and regions.

### **Channel Insights**

* **Email** and **Social Media** generate the most revenue.
* **Direct Mail** has the strongest conversion efficiency but limited reach.
* **Email** has poor conversion efficiency, despite high revenue.

### **Regional Insights**

* **East and West** regions deliver the best ROI.
* North and South consistently underperform.

### **Seasonality**

* **Q3** is the strongest quarter (highest revenue + highest ROI).
* **Q2** is the weak quarter and is ideal for experimentation or testing.

### **Funnel Analysis**

* Strong impressions and clicks, but a major drop-off between clicks and conversions.
* This points to issues with landing pages, user experience, or offer relevance.

## 💡 **Recommendations**

* Increase investment in **Product C**, especially in East and West regions.
* Improve Email conversion rate through better segmentation and A/B testing.
* Expand Direct Mail campaigns for high-value customers.
* Use Q2 as a test period before heavy spending in Q3.
* Focus on conversion rate optimization to reduce friction after clicks.

# ✈️ Airline Loyalty Program Campaign Analysis

### 📍 Project Overview

This project analyzes **customer loyalty program data** from *Northern Lights Air (NLA)*, a fictitious airline based in Canada.
In an effort to boost membership, NLA ran a **promotional campaign (Feb–Apr 2018)** aimed at improving enrollment and engagement.

The analysis evaluates the **impact of the campaign** on customer behavior, focusing on:

* Enrollment growth
* Flight activity
* Reward redemption patterns
* Long-term customer value

Two customer groups were compared:

* 🟩 **Promotion Enrollment**
* 🟦 **Standard Enrollment**

---

### 🎯 Objectives

To assess how the **Feb–Apr 2018 promotion** influenced:

* 🧮 **Loyalty program enrollments** (gross and net growth)
* ✈️ **Flight booking activity** during and after the campaign
* 💰 **Points accumulation vs. redemption behavior**
* 🔁 **Long-term customer value and engagement**

**Data Source:** [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/)

### 📊 Key Findings

#### 🧾 Enrollment Impact

* Overall loyalty program enrollment **increased by 20% in 2018**, despite a **20% drop** in standard enrollments.
* **Promotion enrollments made up one-third (33%)** of all 2018 signups.

#### ✈️ Flight Activity

* Total flights rose by **0.6 million** between 2017 and 2018.
* Flight bookings **spiked during the promotion** and stayed **high in May–July**, showing sustained engagement beyond the campaign period.

#### 💳 Loyalty Engagement

* Both groups had a **low redemption-to-accumulation ratio**, suggesting members didn’t find enough value in redeeming points → potential **churn risk**.
* However, the **dollar value of redeemed points increased**, showing a **more active and valuable customer base** in 2018.

#### 💼 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

* Customers from the **Promotion Enrollment** group had a **higher CLV**, making them **more profitable long-term** than standard customers.

### 💡 Key Takeaway

The **promotion successfully increased enrollments** and attracted **high-value customers**.
However, **low redemption engagement** threatens long-term loyalty.

To maintain retention, the program must become more:
✅ Rewarding
✅ Accessible
✅ Visible

---

### 📈 Recommendations

1. **Continue Targeted Promotions** during key travel seasons (festive periods, pre-summer).
2. **Improve Reward Redemption:**

   * Simplify redemption rules and processes.
   * Send personalized reminders about unused points.
   * Offer **time-limited bonuses** to encourage quick redemption.
3. **Launch Re-engagement Campaigns** for customers with large unused point balances.
4. **Monitor Post-Campaign Behavior** to measure improvements in engagement, redemption, and retention.

PROJECT OVERVIEW 

This project explores customer loyalty program data from Northern Lights Air (NLA), a fictitious airline based in Canada. In an effort to improve program enrollment, NLA launched a promotional campaign between February and April 2018. 

This analysis evaluates the impact of the promotional campaign on customer behavior and loyalty engagement.
The study compares Promotion Enrollment vs Standard Enrollment groups to determine whether the campaign successfully improved membership, flight activity, and customer lifetime value.

🎯 OBJECTIVES

To assess how the Feb–Apr 2018 promotion influenced:
  - Loyalty program enrollments (gross and net growth)
  - Flight booking activity during and after the campaign
  - Points accumulation and redemption behavior
  - Long-term customer value and engagement

DATA SOURCE: Maven Analytics 

📊 KEY FINDINGS:

*Enrollment Impact:*
Overall loyalty program enrollment increased by 20% in 2018, despite a 20% drop in standard enrollments. Promotion enrollments accounted for one-third (33%) of all 2018 signups.

*Flight Activity:*
Total flights increased by 0.6 million between 2017 and 2018.
Flight bookings spiked during the promotion and maintained an upward trend in the months after, i.e, May–July. 
This indicates a sustained engagement beyond the campaign period.

*Loyalty Engagement:*
Both groups had a low redemption-to-accumulation ratio, suggesting members didn’t see enough value in redeeming points. This points to a potential churn risk.
However, the dollar value of redeemed points increased in 2018, indicating a more active and engaged customer base overall compared to the previous year.

*Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):*
"Promotion Enrollment" customers showed a higher CLV than standard customers, making them more valuable in the long term.

💡 Key Takeaway

The promotion was effective in driving enrollments and attracting high-value customers.
However, low redemption engagement poses a risk to long-term loyalty.

To maintain retention, the program must become more rewarding, accessible, and visible to members.

📈 Recommendations

1. Continue Targeted Promotions at key travel periods (e.g., festive season, pre-summer).

2. Improve Reward Redemption, eg, by implementing the following strategies:

    - Simplify redemption rules and processes.
    
    - Send personalized reminders for point balances.
    
    - Offer time-limited redemption bonuses to prompt immediate engagement.

3. Launch Re-engagement Campaigns targeting members with large unused point balances.

4. Track Post-Campaign Behavior to measure whether engagement initiatives improve redemption and retention.

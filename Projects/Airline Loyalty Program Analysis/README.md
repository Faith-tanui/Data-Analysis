PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project explores customer loyalty program data from Northern Lights Air (NLA), a fictitious airline based in Canada. In an effort to improve program enrollment, NLA launched a promotional campaign between February and April 2018. 

This analysis evaluates the impact of the promotional campaign on customer behavior and loyalty engagement.
The study compares Promotion Enrollment vs Standard Enrollment groups to determine whether the campaign successfully improved membership, flight activity, and customer lifetime value.

🎯 OBJECTIVES
To assess how the Feb–Apr 2018 promotion influenced:
  - Loyalty program enrollments (gross and net growth)
  - Flight booking activity during and after the campaign
  - Points accumulation and redemption behavior
  - Long-term customer value and engagement

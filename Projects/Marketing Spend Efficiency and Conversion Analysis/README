📊Marketing Spend Efficiency & Conversion Analysis
Project Overview
The objective of this analysis was to identify inefficiencies in marketing spend, understand where conversion performance breaks down, and determine whether budget is being disproportionately allocated to low-value customers or underperforming campaigns.

The analysis focuses on channels, campaign types, customer demographics, and funnel behavior to move beyond surface-level engagement metrics and uncover true business impact.
Business Questions
- Where is marketing spend being wasted, and why?
- Which channels and campaign types look effective but underperform on conversion?
- Which customer segments convert the least?
- Where does the marketing funnel break down?
- Are we overspending on low-value customers?

Dataset Summary
The dataset contains ~8,000 customers and includes the following data:
Demographics (Age, Income, Gender)
Marketing attributes (Campaign Channel, Campaign Type, Ad Spend)
Engagement metrics (CTR, Website Visits, Pages per Visit, Time on Site)


Key Findings
1. Channel-Level Performance
Click-through rates(CTRs) are tightly clustered between 15.18% and 15.84%, indicating that all channels are similarly effective at generating traffic.
Traffic generation is not the primary differentiator between channels.
PPC is the most efficient traffic driver, combining high CTR with strong conversion performance.
Social Media shows the lowest conversion rate despite having the lowest ad spend, indicating a high likelihood of a traffic quality and targeting issue, not overspending.
Referral campaigns receive the highest ad spend, yet conversion rates remain similar to lower-spend channels, indicating a diminishing return on investment.

2. Campaign Type Performance
Awareness and Retention campaigns absorb a large share of total spend and show strong engagement metrics.
Despite this, they deliver lower conversion efficiency than Conversion-focused campaigns.
Engagement metrics alone create a false sense of performance, masking weaker business outcomes.

3. Customer Segmentation Insights
Age Groups
18-24 and 60-69 age groups show the lowest conversion rates.
Lower conversion among younger users likely reflects reduced purchasing power.
Lower conversion among older users may indicate usability or trust barriers.
Income Groups
Low and Lower-Middle income segments convert ~0.86 percentage points lower than high-income users.
These segments are more price-sensitive, reducing marginal ROI when broadly targeted.

4. Funnel Analysis
Funnel stages were defined as:
Website Visitors
Engaged Visitors (Pages per Visit > 1 and Time on Site ≥ 2 minutes)
Conversions
Key observations:
98% of customers visit the website, confirming strong traffic acquisition.
Only ~11% drop off between visit and engagement, indicating effective landing pages.
Conversion performance varies significantly by age, income, and channel, confirming that the primary funnel breakdown occurs at the conversion stage, not traffic or engagement.

5. Spend vs Value Assessment
Marketing spend is not sufficiently differentiated by customer value.
Segments clustered in low-conversion, high-spend regions represent lower-value customers receiving disproportionate marketing investment, reducing overall ROI.
This is a budget allocation problem, not a budget size problem.

Key Recommendations
Shift from traffic-based optimization to conversion-based optimization
Engagement metrics (CTR, visits) should not be used as primary success indicators.
Reallocate spend toward high-value segments
Prioritize age and income groups with consistently higher conversion efficiency.
Use Awareness campaigns as feeders, not closers
Awareness traffic should primarily support retargeting and downstream conversion campaigns.
Reduce diminishing returns in high-spend channels
Channels with similar conversion rates but significantly higher spend should be optimized or capped.
Adopt predictive targeting to guide spend decisions
Marketing effectiveness can be improved by predicting who is likely to convert before spend occurs, rather than treating all users equally.
